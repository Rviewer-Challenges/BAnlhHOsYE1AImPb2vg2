I wrote the app using Expo because I wanted to learn to use react-native.

I know some about javascript so I was curious how to build and app to android with javascript, in the past I tried to make an app with cordova but I felt that it was not a enough environment to develop apps, I felt that "react-native" is better that cordova, but in the end I believe that my app could be better if I had done it in java or kotlin.

There some parts of my code that I like, how I wrote the transitions and the animation of the beginning. I like the way that I use to change between dark and light theme.
But what I'm really like of is the class RSStoJSON with which the app can convert a XML of a RSS channel to a JSON. To write that class I was inspired in how [https://rss2json.com](https://rss2json.com) show the JSON. At the beginning I wanted to use rss2json, but I imagined a future where my app was used by many people and I felt that rss2json would not be enough, I know I exaggerated, but I also felt that it would be an interesting challenge.
I think that RSStoJSON class is the most important in my app.
